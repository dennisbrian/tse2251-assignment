# TSE2251 Prototype

Just another prototype built for assignemnt. Again, with my 'boring stack' Ruby on Rails.

This prototype will be so real, it might as well replace FCI's current FYP management system.

## Setup

1. Assuming you have ruby installed in your system, with `gem`, `bundle` commands available in your command line environment.
2. Run `bundle` in the directory.
3. Run `rails db:migrate` then `rails db:seed`.
4. Start the application with `rails s`. Visit the app on <http://localhost:3000>.

## Database Requirement

It uses SQLite. Too lazy to setup PostgreSQL for a prototype. Feel free to pull, bundle install, and run.
