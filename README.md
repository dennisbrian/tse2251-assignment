# TSE2251 Prototype

Just another prototype built for assignemnt. Again, with my 'boring stack' Ruby on Rails.

This prototype will be so real, it might as well replace FCI's current FYP management system.

## Database Requirement

It uses SQLite. Too lazy to setup PostgreSQL for a prototype. Feel free to pull, bundle install, and run.
